                The beauty of Cabana is that the system is built in a way that brings the designer and the developer
                closer together. Instead of speaking in <em>attributes</em> (like font size, color value, pixel widths),
                you speak in <em>components</em> and <em>units</em> (like Hero text, Body text, primary color, and units
                of padding).
            </P>
            <P>
                Spacing is a good example - Cabana is built on the{' '}
                <TextLink href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid" target="_blank">
                    8pt grid system
                </TextLink>{' '}
                and is set up in code to measure units in multiples of 8. In this way, a designer who may choose to use
                32px of padding can easily communicate that it's "4 units" of padding.
            </P>

                Tip: you can also change the units to be based on any units you want. They don't even need to be the
                same multiples.

            <P>
                In early stages of design â€“ Designers and Devs should keep an open dialogue about the product's overall
                visual style, metaphors and heirarchy of components.

            <P>
                In many cases, you'll end up customising the Cabana components to have a certain visual style. To save
                yourself from duplicating the props that define the visual style, it's recommended that you create your
                own instances of Cabana's base "Primitives" and then use these in your apps.
            </P>

            <P>
                Remember that Cabana is a design system. The system is based around <em>constraints</em>. A good way of
                'enforcing' those constraints is to internally set the 'core' or 'fixed' style properties. Of course, to
                not be <em>too restrictive</em>, you can still let the developer override / customise props easily from
                the outside.
            </P>
            <Callout>
                When deciding which props to set in your component definition and which to pass in as props, try to
                think about your component's API from the perspective of <em>"which props are fixed?"</em> and{' '}
                <em>which props will our design system let the user decide case-by-case?"</em>
